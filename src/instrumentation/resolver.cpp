/**
 * @brief Callback applied for a conditional branch. 
 * The semantics of this function is quite sophisticated because each examined branch can fall into 
 * one of 36 different states combined from 4 categories:
 *  1. resolving (resolved, bypassed, neither resolved nor bypassed):                    3 values
 *  2. re-execution number in comparison with the max value N (< N-1, = N-1, > N-1):     3 values
 *  3. examined branch is the focused one (yes, no):                                     2 values
 *  4. new branch taken (yes, no):                                                       2 values 
 * so the total is 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 36 states. The mean idea to treat with this sophistication is to 
 * imagine that the examination, goes along with the execution, and when it meets a conditional 
 * branch then it can make this branch take a new decision or keep the old decision, depending on 
 * the current status of the examined branch, the execution will continue or back to a previous 
 * checkpoint.
 * 
 * (new decision is taken or not) {0,1} ------> current status -------> {0,1} (continue or back)
 *
 * We devise the callback into several smaller functions:
