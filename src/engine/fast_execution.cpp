/**
 * @brief The control moves forward to a previously logged checkpoint. 
 * The semantics of this function is quite sophisticated but can be represented by a functional 
 * view as follows. The execution (starting from a checkpoint) to the current execution order (in 
 * supposing that the instruction at this order is not executed) is represented by a function:
 *                                         f : A -> B
 * where A and B are domains which are Cartesian products of some registers and memory addresses, 
 * the domain A intersects with the input buffer so the values on B will change when the value of 
 * the input changes. The execution from the current execution order (in supposing that the 
 * instruction at this order is executed) to some other order is represented by a function:
 *                                        g : C -> D
 * so that g does not depend on the input. If such a function g is found then the re-execution of 
 * the composing instructions inside g is not necessary, and the execution can jump to the 
 * instruction after g with some rational STATIC (i.e. does not depend on the input) UPDATE.
 * The necessary condition (proof needed here) for the function g is that any instruction (that is 
 * represented also as some function ins: operands -> operands) in g is not derived from any 
 * input-dependent domain in B.
 * There are two principles for the STATIC UPDATE depending on how g is independent from f. First 
 * some instructions on g will re-initialize the domain of B before their execution, e.g. suppose 
 * the function f is composed by:
 *                                        mov ebx, eax
 *                                        add eax, ecx
 * and the function of g is composed by:
 *                                        mov eax, 0x70
 *                                        add eax, 0x90
 * then the value of eax in the computation of g is dependent from one of f. The verification if 
 * some operand (i.e. domain) is re-initialized is taken by observing its life-span: the 
 * re-initialized operand (i.e. eax) has its life-span finished in g (i.e. eax is re-initialized by 
 * the first instruction in g). Second, some instructions on g simply do not use the domain of B, 
 * e.g. the function of g is composed by:
 *                                        add edx, 0x50
 *                                        sub edx, 0x90
 * then the value of edx is dependent from g. The verification in this case is taken also by 
 * observing the dependence between the domain in B and the operands of instruction in g.
 * 
 * Bot the life-span and dependence can be observed in the data-flow graph: so the algorithm for 
 * the STATIC UPDATE is as follows: 
 * Step 1: construction the function g
 *  1.1 in the data-flow graph there no paths from any operand B to any operand in g.
 * 
 * Step 2: static update
 *  2.1 if an operand has its life-span finished in g, then its value is reset by one of the domain 
 *      D after the execution of g,
 *  2.2 if an operand has its life-span beyond g, then its value is kept.
 * 
 * Note that this operation is NOT ALWAYS SAFE because it is not freely called from any execution 
 * order.
 * 
 * @param checkpoint_exeorder the future checkpoint's execution order
 * @return void
