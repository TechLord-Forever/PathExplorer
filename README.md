### PathExplorer: a Pintool for Binary Code Coveraging 

#### The current version is CRAPPY, but the following are (hopefully) stable:

* Dynamic tainting: a graphical tainting mechanism based on the liveness analysis (using the outer interface of live variables).
* Checkpoint detection: multiple (nearest) checkpoints for each conditional branch.

#### In development:

* Reverse execution: a application-layer reverse execution mechanism.
